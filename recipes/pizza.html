	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>

	<ul>Ingredients
		<li>active dry yeast</li>
		<li>bread flour</li>  
		<li>xtra-virgin olive oil</li>  
		<li>low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>  
		<li>olive oil</li>  
		<li>chopped tomatoes</li>  
		<li>oregano, black paper, chilli flakes</li>
		<li>basil leaves</li>  
	</ul>

	<ol>
		<li>Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated. </li>

		<li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise. </li>

		<li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour. </li>

		<li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top. </li>

		<li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes. </li>

		<li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve. </li>
